1. In the Utility Microservice create the Proto file. Example of proto file: Proto file
2. After creating the proto file, build the project by running the 'clean install' command in Maven.
3. Automatically a protobuf file (RuleMetaDataServiceGrpc) will be generated just like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vO6u_Uqc_TQ_qc-xr0YGlqviuWNjYwTa/view?usp=sharing
4. Now we can proceed with writing code for Server and Client microservices. First, we need to add the dependency of the Utility class in both microservices.
   So that we can use the functionality provided by the autogenerated protobuf file.
5. In the Server microservice create a class and extend the 'ImplBase' class. In our example, it would be 'RuleMetaDataServiceImplBase'. 
   This class is present inside the auto-generated protobuf file. 
6. After extending, override the method that we have written in the proto file and write the code for the service that you want to provide to the client. 
   Example of Server class: Server class
7. In the Client microservice, we need to create a class and write code for it. Example of Client class: Client class
8. That's it!!
